# BitShares - Severly Underrated?

Since the inception of BitShares in 2013, it has quietly
been a major innovator in blockchain technology. But for
the laymen and beginner in this sector, it is quite a lot to
just jump in and understand all of the technical details
of the what, when and how, aspects of this technology.
In a nutshell, BitShares leverages “the power of globally
decentralized consensus and decision making (to) more
effectively coordinate the allocation of resources toward
their most productive and valuable use”. Sounds like its
complicated right? Well the details and technical aspects
are but I’ll try to make it simple to understand in this
concise overview of exactly what BitShares is, a little about
their history, and what they stand for as a community as a
whole.

# BACKGROUND

## 1

So, traditionally companies run with a lot of human
management, after all, people need to be there to oversee
exactly what’s happening right? Well with the creation
of Blockchain technology and the inception of DACs
(distributed autonomous companies), BitShares aims to
rewrite the thought process of how things are managed,
and how goals are met. Take banks for example, a lot of
lengthy bureaucratic processes for some of the simplest
of processes. Most major corporations like banks have a
hierarchy that doesn’t allow very much outside consensus
on who exactly is making those major business decisions.
With a DAC, the rules that are in place are open-source,
and completely auditable and transparent. But how can it
be transparent if it’s hosted on a server in control by only
a few people? It’s not, hence the word “distributed”. Since
it is open source it can be spread across all of the token
holder’s computers.

## 2

In the original whitepaper put together by Daniel
Larimer, Stan Larimer, Charles Hoskinson and
Fabian Schuh, they introduced something called
“consensus technology”. Consensus is how
business decisions are made within groups of
people and organizations. Bitcoin was the first to
introduce this in a decentralized manner with a
peer-to-peer network to “efficiently facilitate the
transaction of value”.

# SO ... THAT’S NICE. HOW DOES IT WORK THOUGH?

## 1

Not very difficult to understand if explained
correctly. I will attempt to do this, and if something
is over your head always feel free to consult the
BitShares community directly as well as our own
community if you need questions answered.

## 2

BitShares employs DPOS or Delegated Proof-
of-Stake. What this does, among other things,
is gives each holder of the core token a way to
delegate their vote to a person that does not
control their coins. This in turn maximizes the
performance of the network, and minimizes both
the bandwidth and amount required to secure the
network, reducing cost. DPOS technology allows
for more transactions to occur and also compete
with volume at faster speeds than centralized
systems like the current ACH system that banks
and credit card companies use. The best feature
that DPOS technology produces in my personal
opinion is that because of the transparency of
everything, it allows for every client in a DPOS
system “to decide who is trusted rather than trust
concentrating in the hands of those with the most
resources”. So, the fundamental outcome is that
the core token holders remain in control.

# BREAKING DOWN THE “VOTING SYSTEM”

## 1

So, to keep things a little organized the representatives
are not randomly selected from the total pool of users
because of lack of online users. Every holder of BTS -- the
core token of the BitShares Blockchain -- gets a vote for
someone to sign blocks in their stead. This person is called
a representative (also called a block producer) and are
paid independently of uptime, however if uptime is lacking,
they are likely to be voted out. These representatives take
turns signing blocks, when someone misses out, they are
voted off, and eventually others will get their turn. Incentive
is paid as a small amount to them directly for having 99%
uptime.

## 2

Confused yet? Yeah me too. However, I think the best way
to tell you how this works is to simply state that in a DPOS
system the “Block producers” are selected by those who
own the tokens, and that with traditional Bitcoin, the “Block
producers” are whoever has more money to purchase
mining equipment. So, a traditional POW (Proof-of-work)
system determines the next block producer by requiring
the computer to do the work whereas with a DPOS
(Delegated-Proof-of-Stake) system determines the “Block
producers” by a stake-vote making it fairer and round-robin
so everyone can have a fair chance, rather than just those
with the fanciest mining equipment.

# THE AVERAGE STAKE-HOLDER

## 1

The BitShares Blockchain features a built-in
decentralized exchange (DEX) for all tokens
listed on it. Anyone that uses it is required to
create a unique handle (account name) which
acts as a mailing address. The account name
IS the address to send and receive tokens. This
simplifies integration and reduces the need
to store thousands of addresses with their
corresponding keys. Easy. The block producers
as mentioned before, are the ones maintaining
the network, the “committee members” are those
that volunteer to keep the community organized
and propose changes to the BitShares networks
parameters, like transaction fees. There are other
roles as well such as workers that are being paid
for what they propose to do like innovating the
BitShares network as well as marketers that are
paid in referral fees.

## 2

Even with all of these roles, those that are simply
just wanting to use the DEX are still considered
BTS Holders and can cast a vote and influence
the DACs business and future integration.
BitShares, upon inception and still currently,
never makes claims to be a “currency”. They
consider the BTS token an utility that gives you a
say in the governance of the whole decentralized
blockchain. BitShares never did an ICO, yet
when you look at it this way it boggles to mind as
to why MORE ICOs are NOT using this model?
If you invest in a company you should have a
say in what direction the company decides to
head in, and the same applies to a blockchain.
This is the entire philosophy and concept behind
BitShares being not only a DEX, but a DAC
business that utilizes DPOS technology. Makes
a little more sense, now right? I think so. In
order to get to this “ah-ha” moment you have
to effectively explain all of these aspects of what
they are and do individually.

# IN CLOSING...

If you are looking for more information on how to become
a role-playing “witness” in the BitShares community they
have very extensive documentation and I would like to
direct you to their website at bitshares.org to learn more
about payouts, workers, and how to submit proposals
to them as well. We here @gokhshtein magazine have
done just this to sponsor this very article, the interview that
follows it, and have not only enjoyed working with their
community very much, but have learned a great deal about
how it all works in the process. It was all very fascinating
in a space dominated by traditional ICOs and I personally
found myself very surprised I had not heard of this
sooner. BitShares is on the cusp of integrating this kind of
technology through spreading awareness into many facets
of how we transact and do traditional business every day.
I believe with some proper research and development by
major players both in and outside of this space this form of
business will eventually be at the foundation of everything
we do in many different industries in years to come. Hats
off to the BitShares community and those developing it,
truly the most underrated tech in the blockchain field.

# INTERVIEW WITH STEFAN & FABIAN

## SO JUST TO START THINGS OFF, IS IT POSSIBLE TO TELL US EXACTLY WHAT ROLE YOU PLAY AT BITSHARES CONSIDERING THERE ARE DIFFERENT CONTRIBUTION LEVELS IN THE HIERARCHY OR THE “ROLE” YOU PLAY?

### Stefan:

I am a senior developer at Blockchain Projects B.V. in the
Netherlands and an active member of the BitShares community.
My public involvement focuses around several workers, mainly
the BitShares UI worker (code review) and just recently a
marketing worker (organizer). The worker proposal system is
what the BitShares Blockchain uses to generate funding in a
trustless way for people to engage in the community and evolve
it. A worker proposal is put on-chain and voted on by all BTS
holders. If it is approved, the Blockchain automatically pays out a
defined amount of BTS daily. Funds for workers are provided by
the reserve pool, which is in turn refilled by collecting transaction
fees for anyone that uses the Blockchain. After all, conducting
and publishing this interview is also funded by such a worker
proposal.

### FABIAN (a.k.a. @xeroc):

Being part of the BitShares community since its inception, I
play multiple roles. Most prominently, I am the developer of
the python-bitshares library among countless tools for the
BitShares blockchain and other Graphene-based blockchains.
Additionally, I am one of the top 3 proxies, which means many
BTS holders have put their trust in me so that I can vote on their
behalf. Last but not least, I am member of the committee which
is a group of entities and businesses on the blockchain that have
additional privileges of jointly modifying blockchain parameters
(block size, block confirmation times) and transaction fees.
Since late 2015, I am full-time in the blockchain space and have
founded multiple companies and am now the CTO of of the
joint venture Blockchain Projects B.V.

## WHEN DID YOU ORIGINALLY GET INVOLVED WITH BITSHARES? HOW ABOUT WITH BLOCKCHAIN TECH IN GENERAL? I FIND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD NO PRIOR BACKGROUND IN A TECHNOLOGY FIELD AND EITHER ADAPTED OR INNOVATED THE SPACE IN THEIR OWN LIKING, IS THIS HOW YOU SEE YOUR STORY AS WELL?

### Stefan:

I got into blockchain tech in September 2017 when
I started working at Blockchain Projects BV, and I
also had no prior background there. I came from the
university having studied applied mathematics and
slipped into the BitShares community during my work.
Fabian Schuh (@xeroc, and my mentor) on the other
hand is measured in the age of the Blockchain, a
grandpa in the field. See his introduction below.

### Fabian:

I am an entrepreneur and fervent Blockchain advocate
who came in contact with crypto currencies in early
2011 and was fascinated by their autonomous
nature and social and political implications. As an
alumni of FAU Erlangen (Germany), where I earned
my doctorate in engineering, I decided to focus on
Blockchain technologies, and especially Distributed
Autonomous Companies (a concept first introduced
by Daniel Larimer). I founded ChainSquad GmbH
and have been technical consultant and developer for
numerous projects throughout the Blockchain space.
Recently, I joined forces with European entrepreneurs
in Blockchain Projects B.V. (Netherlands) to focus on
development and advocating the advancement of
Blockchain technologies in Europe on a larger scale.

## SO, AFTER DOING RESEARCH ON HOW MANY PEOPLE (WITNESSES) ARE IN CHARGE OF SECURING THE NETWORK, THE MINIMUM NUMBER IS 11? IS THIS STILL TRUE AND IS THERE A TECHNICAL OR LOGICAL EXPLANATION BY THAT SPECIFIC NUMBER?

The BitShares Blockchain is secured by block producers
(witnesses) that do exactly that (produce blocks). The
number of block producers is up for vote by the BTS
holders. It can be anything between 11 and 1001.
For security reasons, the number of block producers
should be odd. Currently, there are 25 witnesses
producing blocks on the BitShares Blockchain. Given
the importance of the number of block producers and
for the decentralization of a Blockchain, we would like
to emphasize that each active block producer has equal
rights and powers to produce a block. Each round,
every producer can only produce exactly one block, no
more, no less and the time instant at which they have to
produce their block is known in advance. Each round,
the ordering of block producers is shuffled. Additionally,
block producers can be voted out by BTS voters (and
proxies) within less than 1 hour.

## WITH BITSHARES 2.0, DOCUMENTATION STATES THAT “AS AN EXCHANGE YOU DON’T NEED TO EVER DEAL WITH ADDRESSES AGAIN”, I UNDERSTAND THE TECH BEHIND THIS, BUT IS THIS SOMETHING OTHER EXCHANGES BOTH DEX AND CENTRALIZED WILL BE ABLE TO UTILIZE? IS THIS BTS SPECIFIC AND HAVE ANY ENTITIES EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THIS? 

This is a feature of blockchains based on the Graphene
technology. Opinions here may vary since Graphene
is not a defined terminology, yet I would consider
BitShares, Steem and EOS based on Graphene
(including any forks of those three). There is a
whitepaper by the Graphene Foundation that makes
an attempt to give a definition. What the statement in
the question means is that users are able to choose
an account name for themselves on the BitShares
Blockchain instead of having to deal with addresses like
Bitcoin (hieroglyphic to the common eye). This greatly
improves the user experience and facilitates handling the
account. Any other exchange is already utilizing that for
deposit and withdrawal of any token that is based on the
BitShares Blockchain. Imagine withdrawing BTS from a
CEX into your own wallet. You simply enter the account
name in the CEX as the target.

## THE BITSHARES COMMUNITY DEVELOPS AND DESIGNS YOUR TRADING PLATFORM, ARE YOU PERSONALLY HAPPY WITH IT, AND ARE THERE PLANS FOR ANY MAJOR CHANGES OR ADDITIONS IN THE NEAR FUTURE WE CAN LOOK FORWARD TO?

### 1

I am personally not an active trader, and as such it is hard
for me answer that properly. Considering the frontend and
from what I have heard in the community, the current frontend
(BitShares UI) is not giving the best user experience. Luckily,
this is being tackled with a complete remake of the UI focused
on user experience supported by a prominent design studio.
Additionally, there is a feature-reduced UI being built whose
goal is to provide a beginner friendly and trader targeted
experience for interaction with the DEX. On a side note: The
current BitShares UI seeks to showcase the vast set of features
provided by the BitShares Blockchain and was created back in
2014. It certainly lacks up-to-date and modern design choices
and was throughout driven by the community. It is meant as a
reference to show the possibilities to invite businesses to build
on the BitShares Blockchain as a decentralized platform.

### 2

Considering the general advancement of the BitShares
Blockchain there has been vast progress lately. The community
has funded worker proposals for software development in total
over 1 million USD for 2018 alone, and approved already over
2,2 million USD for 2019 for software development, marketing
and public appearance. That budget is paid out using bitUSD
or bitCNY, both stable coins that are built-in the BitShares
Blockchain and peg the value to their FIAT counterpart.
Many professional developers and entrepreneurs make their
living through those worker proposals, all joining hands to
enhance the BitShares Blockchain as a competitive platform.
This represents 2% of the current market cap of the BitShares
Blockchain, which is astounding for a fully autonomous and
decentralized community.

# Here is an overview of current projects:

## BITSHARES COMMUNITY WALLET

The community wallet is an open-source and fully
responsive web frontend whose goal is to provide
a user friendly and trader targeted experience
for interaction with the DEX of the BitShares
Blockchain.

## ROSSUL/GRAPHENE LABS TEAM - BITSHARES EXCHANGE UX/UI REDESIGN PROJECT

The BitShares UI has been designed in 2014
and was driven by functionality. This worker
will provide a redesign that is focused on user
experience.

## THE BITSHARES UI MAINTENANCE TEAM & BEET - YOUR BLOCKCHAIN COMPANION

The BitShares UI (aka Reference UI) is constantly
being developed, bugs removed and new features
and use cases added. Additionally, this worker
funds the development of Beet. Interacting with
the BitShares Blockchain can be cumbersome if
you are not familiar with the importance of key
security. In general, every action on the BitShares
Blockchain (and any other blockchain) requires the
private keys of the involved accounts. When you
are then using third party tools (especially closed
source ones), the question about trust quickly
arises. Being closed source can be a business
model, but should not hinder adoption. Beet aims
to solve that by providing an open source, audited
and fully transparent key management and
signing tool that can be locally installed (inspired
by Scatter for EOS) and supports multiple
blockchains (BitShares, EOS, Steem, and forks
of each). In combination with the Hashed Time-
Locked Contracts (HTLC), Beet will allow easy-to-
use atomic cross chain swaps of tokens.

## BITSHARES MOBILE APP

Mobile phones have become an indispensable part of people’s
lives, and people are used to handling various things through
mobile phones. BitShares is a 24/7 decentralized exchange
where people can log in to their accounts at any time to view
markets, or trade, or transfer money. Therefore, a mobile wallet
with good experience and complete functions is urgently needed
in the market. This work implements an open source mobile
wallet with native support for Android and iOS (pending).

## DEXBOT

Liquidity – the ability to easily buy and sell an asset at a fair
price – is an important marker for any exchange. By the adding
of liquidity on various trading pairs, customers can more easily
trade, get a better price, and find more stable markets. While
primarily a software development project, DEX liquidity greatly
benefits from cultivating relationships and encouraging DEXBot
use from prominent individuals in the wider market making
community. The DEXBot software builds liquidity on markets, is
open for all to use, increases the number of transactions on the
blockchain, and helps pay for itself through increased trading
fees. Better spreads, increased liquidity, and communication
with potential power-users of DEXBot will help the BitShares DEX
attract more tokens and users.

## BITSHARES CORE DEVELOPMENT TEAM

The BitShares Core (backend) contains all operations that
represent the possible interactions with the BitShares Blockchain.
The consensus mechanism used is delegated proof of stake. The
backend is continuously developed, including bug fixing and
consensus unrelated plugins (e.g. Elastic Search database plugin
to facilitate access to blockchain operation data while reducing
requirements on the server). Once every half year a consensus
changing release is done, a so-called protocol upgrade (in
contrast to a hard fork). Due to the consensus mechanism there
can only be one chain after the protocol upgrade. All consensus
changes require the approval of the BTS holders by means of
voting. Current consensus changes are listed below (BSIPs).

# BITSHARES IMPROVEMENT PROPOSALS (BSIP)

## Market Fee Sharing

The BitShares Blockchain employs a fixed network fee for its users for
every interaction with the blockchain. Those fees are shared with the
referrer that onboarded the interacting account. In order to create more
incentive for webmasters to refer to the BitShares Blockchain, market fees
are collected through trading on the DEX of the BitShares Blockchain. This
is an important step to enhance adoption.

## Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLC)

The ability to securely hold tokenized assets within a hashed time-locked
contract on the BitShares blockchain is a desirable feature that could be
used by many persons, services, and businesses to mitigate risks between
participants during asset transfer. HTLC implement conditional transfers,
whereby a designated party (the “recipient”) will reveal the preimage
of a hash in order to execute the asset transfers from a second party
(the “depositor”), else after time lock expiry “depositor” may retrieve
their assets. No third-party escrow agent is required, rather the HTLC
operation enforces conditions, evaluations and transfers through the
BitShares consensus protocol. This is the first step towards cross-chain
atomic swaps, which are essential for a decentralized exchange to allow
trading of assets in a true trustless setting.

## Custom Active Authorities

### 1

Every account interacts with the BitShares Blockchain by means of signed
transactions indicating the desired action of the user. This has the benefit
that there is no central authority that needs to be trusted, and brings
the downside that the user needs to secure the private key to create the
signatures. A compromised private key likely result in permanent loss of
the contained funds.

### 2

Custom active authorities allow to create additional keys with specific
purpose (everything else is prohibited), for example for users of the
DEX a so-called Trading Key, which only allows trading on predefined
markets. The implementation is flexible and allows full customization
of the restrictions what the key can do. This also enhances security for
businesses that are running automated software for interaction with the
blockchain by creating keys that only allow the intended use case.

# Other

## PUBLICLY APPROVED BITSHARES REPRESENTATIVE

The distributed governance may
result in certain aspects not being
continuously tended to, which is a
dealbreaker when it comes to legal
matters. The BitShares Blockchain
Foundation has obtained a
mandate through this worker
proposal to represent the BitShares
Community in legal matters,
including e.g. dealings with
regulators and exchange listings.

## HACK THE DEX - A BITSHARES BUG BOUNTY PROGRAM

The bug bounty program gives
incentive to security researchers
and penetration testers to disclose
vulnerabilities, and enhance the
security of the Blockchain.
Payouts are up to 25,000 bitUSD.

## BITSHARES.ORG

The initiative is a clear path
to an updated, optimized and
professionally managed
BitShares.org domain/website
that will provide a professional
and corporate experience to our
visitors, clients and on-boarding
businesses, completed with a
monthly newsletter and fresh
branding.

# Getting back to the questions:

## IN YOUR OWN OPINION WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF THE BITUSD VERSUS OTHER SO CALLED “STABLECOINS” AND TETHER? THIS SEEMS TO BE A HOT TOPIC LATELY SINCE THE INCEPTION OF SO MANY DIFFERENT KINDS, WHAT MAKES YOUR OWN “SMARTCOIN” UNIQUE AND MORE USEFUL THAN ALL THE OTHERS TO CHOOSE FROM?

BitUSD and its siblings (BitCNY, BitEUR, etc.) are
collateralized debt obligations and not minted
like other “stablecoins” by a centralized business
that claim full reserves and backing. This concept
is also what e.g. MakerDAO’s DAI evolved from.
The basic difference is that the backing is based
on another crypto token on the same Blockchain,
such that full reserves is not only publicly auditable
but also a technical requirement that is enforced by
smart contracts (the loan agreement). That makes
bitassets inherently more trustworthy than centralized
“stablecoins”.

## RECENTLY THERE IS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT BINANCE AND THEIR SO-CALLED “DEX” EXCHANGE. DO YOU THINK THIS WILL BE MAJOR COMPETITION SO TO SPEAK FOR BITSHARES?

### 1

We very much welcome the initiative of Binance to take a step
towards decentralization -- in fact the BitShares community
has applied for the Binance Dexathon -- and appreciate the
additional spotlight on decentralized exchanges (DEX). If
the market decides that a “DEX” offered and operated by a
centralized entity sufficiently fulfills the need for trustworthiness
and transparency as compared to a community-driven, fully
transparent and permissionless Blockchain that anyone can
participate in, then there are bright prospects for Binances’
chain. Will it become a competitor to the BitShares Blockchain?
The Binance chain has potential to host a decentralized
exchange in the case that they take further steps to decentralize
block production and other aspects, and become truly
permission-less. What we can interpret from the available
documentation, the Binance chain will allow non-custodial use
of the core token BNB, with custodial colored coins (IOUs) for
external tokens like BTC and BTS.

### 2

The downside of a fully decentralized platform like the BitShares
Blockchain is (oh the irony) the lack of a central authority that
can enforce how things are done, including the marketing
budget. I suspect that a CEX will always have a bigger marketing
budget than the BitShares Blockchain, and that is the key to
onboarding the curious and new-in-crypto users.

## IN YOUR OWN OPINION AFTER READING INTO THEIR EXCHANGE, DO YOU FEEL IT IS A TRUE “DEX” LIKE BITSHARES? IF NOT DO YOU THINK IT WILL HAVE ITS OWN STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES TO LESS “TECH-SAVVY” INDIVIDUALS NEWER TO BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY?

These days, the term “DEX” became very much
a buzzword for marketing with only few people
understanding its meaning. So far, Binance’s DEX
hasn’t launched and thus, we could only speculate on
its success.

## AS MAJOR MEDIA AND GENERAL AWARENESS ABOUT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY INCREASES, IT BECOMES EASIER TO USE FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON. DO YOU FEEL THAT MOST PEOPLE COMING INTO THE MARKET OR ADAPTING TO IT WILL SEE THE BENEFITS OF A DEX OVER AN EXCHANGE LIKE BAKKT?

Similar to the answers above, this really depends
on market needs. There will always be markets that
cannot legally operate on a public Blockchain, while
other markets will only stay competitive if they moved
onto a public Blockchain. In the latter case, the
BitShares Blockchain represents the entity that offers a
trading environment for custom tokens the -- easiest,
the cheapest and safest, provably and reliably since
2015.

## AS A FINAL QUESTION, DO YOU FEEL THERE IS A NEED FOR MORE AWARENESS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF DEX’S AND HOW TRANSPARENCY AND COMMUNITIES LIKE BITSHARES CAN BENEFIT THE INDUSTRY?

We certainly agree with the sentiment of the questions.
Additionally, to the need for more awareness (also on the
technical details), we believe that the experienced BitShares
community could be beneficial to many projects. For instance,
the MakerDAO concept of DAI and SAI evolved from the origins
of bitsharestalk.org, a platform where the pros and cons of
crypto collateralized loans (like bitUSD) are constantly discussed.

## ONE LAST COMMENT, YOU WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THE “SCAM” THING AND PUT THAT TO A REST, DO YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER COMMENTS ON THIS SUBJECT BEFORE WE’RE FINISHED?

There are articles and publications on the BitShares Blockchain
now and then, and unfortunately there are sometimes comments
like “this is not dead yet?”, “this is a scam” or other unwarranted
FUD. The BitShares Blockchain is a fully decentralized platform,
which is a beauty and a curse. In the case of a decentralized
community with a permissionless Blockchain it is a curse because
it allows anyone to build on top of it, including scammers and
fraudsters. For example, there is no central authority who can
remove or hinder people to create assets whose only target is
to relieve the users of their other valuable tokens. This does not
make the platform a scam and the users need to be educated in
the matter. It merely shows that a truly permissionless platform
requires well educated users that understand the need to do
their own due diligence, a fundamental requirement in the crypto
currency space that the entire community has yet to learn. In the
case of the BitShares Blockchain, there are many serious and
profitable businesses making use of the BitShares Blockchain
as their fundamental core technology. These businesses will
soon leverage the true spirit of synergy as they are based on a
common ledger.
